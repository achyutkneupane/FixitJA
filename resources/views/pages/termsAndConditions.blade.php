                            When a project has been completed, you may be offered the ability to pay your Service Professional directly via the FIXIT-JA mobile application (“FIXIT-JA Pay”). If your Service Professional has opted in to FIXIT-JA Pay, you will be able to log into your FIXIT-JA App, select which Service Professional you are paying, enter the amount of the payment, and input your method of payment (only credit cards are permitted). Your Service Professional may also initiate the payment request. If you use FIXIT-JA Pay to pay your Service Professional but did not book your home service through FIXIT-JA, you will not be eligible for the FIXIT-JA Guarantee. By using FIXIT-JA Pay even where you were not previously a FIXIT-JA member, you are agreeing to FIXIT-JA’s terms and conditions.

While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any damage that may result should any information be released to any third parties, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages that may result therefrom.

                <p>
                    While we cannot guarantee the work performed by a listed Service Professional, and while we have no obligation to you with regard to your relationship with a Service Professional, the FIXIT-JA resolution process has been developed to try and assist you in resolving any disputes that may arise in the course of a home improvement repair or maintenance project with a Service Professional who you learned about through the FIXIT-JA Services. Without modifying our statements under this Agreement, we may, upon your request, provide limited assistance in resolving disputes between you and a Service Professional. You must participate and use good faith efforts to resolve problems through the FIXIT-JA resolution process. Such limited assistance in no way nullifies the release and indemnification described in these Terms & Conditions. You agree not to refuse to pay a Service Professional without a good faith basis for doing so. You agree that FIXIT-JA is not responsible for the accessibility or unavailability of any Service Professional or for your interactions and dealings with a Service Professional.

                <p>
                    Unless otherwise noted on the screening tab of a Service Professional's profile page, FIXITJA.com uses the following criteria as part of its registration enrollment process ("registration") for new Service Professional businesses, with the exception of Corporate Accounts (as described below) which IS NOT screened) applying for membership in our network. We perform the below screening at the time of the Service Professional business' enrollment:

                            <strong>Licensing</strong> - We confirm that a prospective new SP business has any applicable required trade licensing for the services for which we match them to consumers. We recommend you confirm SPECIFIC licensing requirements with the business and the applicable GOVERNING licensing authorities. We recommend you confirm these licensing requirements before proceeding with your project. Larger projects often require the use of sub-contractors for specific types of work (for example, a kitchen remodel may require an electrician or plumber). We recommend you verify that all the sub-contractors doing work on your project carry the appropriate licensing. We always recommend that you ask the business to provide you with a copy of their license.

                            <strong>Criminal Records Search</strong> - We use third party data sources to conduct a criminal search, ON THE owner/principal of the company, for any relevant criminal convictions associated with the owner/principal of the business, within the three years prior to such service professional's application for membership in the FIXIT-JA network. FIXIT-JA's third-party vendor uses a national criminal database ("NCD") to screen our service professionals. The comprehensiveness of the NCD varies.

Please note that only a fingerprint match can guarantee an accurate match for a sex offender search. We recommend that you check the applicable sex offender websites for any individuals that will be performing work in your home.

THUS, FIXIT-JA CANNOT AND DOES NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT PROFILE AND SCREENING INFORMATION IS UP TO DATE. FIXIT-JA IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S SCREENING INFORMATION. WE RECOMMEND THAT BEFORE WORKING WITH A SERVICE PROFESSIONAL YOU VERIFY THAT INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE SERVICE PROFESSIONAL'S PROFILE IS STILL ACCURATE, CURRENT AND ACCEPTABLE TO YOU.

                    Service Professionals Profiles: FIXIT-JA allows Service Professionals to post profiles about themselves and their business on the FIXITJA.COM or apps. FIXIT-JA does not review or verify the information or representations set forth in those profiles, except as expressly set forth above, as they are self-reported by the Service Professional. FIXIT-JA therefore makes no representations or warranties regarding any information posted by a Service Professional, and assumes no liability for such information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The above procedures may change from time to time at the sole discretion of FIXIT-JA. FIXIT-JA believes that it uses commercially reasonable methods to check these matters but does not make any representations or warranties that members continue to meet the above screening criteria after the date of their enrollment in the FIXIT-JA network. When it comes to screening, every system has its flaws. That is because no background system in the Caribbean is one hundred percent accurate. FIXIT-JA does not represent or warrant that the information received from government agencies or from third party sources is accurate, error free, or that it is up to date or updated at the time that FIXIT-JA checks such information. Most agencies have periodic update cycles or schedules and this information is not updated on a real-time basis by such agencies and third party sources.

                                    The FIXIT-JA Happiness Guarantee provides certain limited protections provided by FIXIT-JA for Qualifying Services. Subject to the below exclusions and the terms and conditions and limitations herein, if you are dissatisfied with the performance of a Qualifying Service, FIXIT-JA will either (a) have the Qualifying Service reperformed by the same or a different Service Professional; or (b) compensate you: (1) the amount you paid though the FIXIT-JA Platform for the Qualifying Service; plus (2) the amount of damage that can be proven by you, in FIXIT-JA’s sole determination, was directly caused by such Qualifying Service. In no event shall FIXIT-JA’s liability under the FIXIT-JA Happiness Guarantee exceed Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00) per incident.

The applicable exclusions of the FIXIT-JA Happiness Guarantee are different depending upon whether or not you paid a fixed, upfront price for the Qualifying Service.

                            Eligibility - You are eligible for the FIXIT-JA Service Guarantee provided that you report the issue within ninety (90) days after you made the last payment toward the Qualifying Service by contacting FIXIT-JA by phone at (876) 527-0157, by email at customersolutions@FIXITJA.COM, or by online chat and providing all of the requested information about your issue. If you do not report the issue within ninety (90) days after you made the last payment toward the Qualifying Service, your claim is ineligible for the FIXIT-JA Happiness Guarantee.

                            By using the Website and/or FIXIT-JA's services in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and FIXIT-JA. YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. For details on the arbitration process, see our Arbitration Procedures.

                            Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against FIXIT-JA may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in JAMAICA. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
